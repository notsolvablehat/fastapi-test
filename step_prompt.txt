I want to create a html css and js project. I want you to analyse screen_specifications and tell me a project structure. Respond with what files are needed to make this application fully function in the following format:
{html: [html file names with path], js: [js file names with path]}

- first generated js files. 
- For routing, create a main.js file and link this in all the html files.
- use mock data where necessary. Do not use API calls. Instead, comment the part where API can be used. 
- for assets, use fontawesome cdn for icons. Images can be ignored and replaced with placeholder texts.
- All linking must be done before. No extra linking js files after the html files have been generated.
- Do not include the js files that are not necessary. Like just showing console.log. Instead these can be embedded in html itself 
- if any updates are required to previously generated files, generate the complete file with new updates.
- Use inline css for all the files. Donot create new files for css.

# IMPORTANT
- Always create an entry point for the app to start. If there are more than single user for the application, you must route this using the login page. 
- For login credentials, show them as the "info" in the login page itself. Both password and email/username. 

- Put the files in respective paths. Example: js/utils/.. or js/components/ or js/<user specific folder name>. This is optional but recommended.
